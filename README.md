# SoC-Developing-Trading-Strategy-with-Pine-Script

This repository contains my scripts for various Trading Indicators and Strategies, written in Pine Script on Trading View, as a part of Seasons of Code (SoC) 2023 conducted by the Web and Coding Club (WnCC), IIT Bombay. 

## Technical Analysis
Technical analysis is a financial trading discipline employing patterns in market data to analyse trends, identify trading opportunities and make predictions. Two major types of technical analysis are:
- Chart Patterns
- Technical (Statistical) Indicators
Some of the popular technical [indicators](./Indicators) include Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and Relative strength index (RSI). In this project, a few technical indicators have been scripted in Pine Script, and can also be compared with chart patterns by running the scripts on a platform such as [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/pine/).
